The purpose of the analysis was to summarize the statics by filtering data for the two months,June and December, comparing the over all possible effects on the ice cream's shop business based on the surf and tempeture. The Oahu's percipition data for the months of June and December was measured by W. Avy team to be anaylzed for investment purposes. The concern was if the surf ice cream business was this business going to be sucessful during the months of June and December in Oahu? It was suggested to do a sample for the months of June and December. This would make a detemination of the ice cream shop would be able to maintain an equitable annual business.  

  The results of the list contains three major points from the two anaylsis reports that were reviewed to determine if ther overall temp was a cause for the buisess to decline. We also analyzed the percipitation in the month of December, and how it effected the outcome of the business due to extreme or severe weather such as temperature fluctuations.

December 

As we can see in the data the June and December tempetures maximum were at 85 degrees. The tempeture in December minimum range was at 56 degress where the June minimum recond was 64 degrees. W. Avy was not sure if the low tempetures were going to linger for longer duration. This haunted him with the glooming idea that this would contribute to driving his clients away along with his profits. So he reviewed the data from both months as a sample to analyze. He revied that 75% of the data retrieved in the month of June and December projected the tempeture in Oahu to be 77 degrees and 74 degress respectively. A lingering uncerainty if this was warm enough to increase to momentum of his sales. 

  Overview of the anaylsis is that due 75% of the temperature in the 70s it may be a graduate to moderate range for customers to be intersted in surf and ice cream. It may be recommmented for a further analysis of the weather participation patterns for both of those two months as well. 

  This is a high level summary results and two additional queries on weather data for June and December, so that the analysis for their business in Oahu would be a sample data anaylsis.
